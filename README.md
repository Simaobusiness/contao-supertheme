## How does it work?

### 1.) Assign assets to a layout
Open the Contao backend and go to "Themes" and click the pagelayout icon. 
Then edit your existing layout or create a new one. 

At the stylesheets section you can now add SCSS Files.

At the bottom of the page you now can select Javascript and Coffeescript files.

***Hint:*** *By dragging the items, you can change the order they get later included in the page.*


### 2.) Optional: Assign assets to a page
You can assign assets to a single page as well. Just edit a page and go to the Expert section.
Now you should the External Coffee-/Javascript select-field.

### ThatÂ´s it.
Refresh your frontend page and have a look at the html markup.

**SuperTheme automatically compiles your assets, combines them and adds them to your webpage.**
